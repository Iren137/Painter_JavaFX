# Painter JavaFX

This is an application written in Java by analogy with the Windows Painter. Allows rollback of changes and reversion of rolled back changes. In the painter, you can draw by hand, draw lines, rectangles, circles, ellipses, insert text; change the color and thickness of the pen, draw shapes filled/unfilled, and erase changes with an eraser. You can also save photos to your computer or upload photos from your computer to the application.
